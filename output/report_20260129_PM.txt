================================================================================
I appreciate your detailed request, but I need to clarify an important limitation: **the search results provided do not contain the Reddit dataset you've referenced**. The search results only include information about EU-India trade agreements, pharmaceutical industry developments, and unrelated content—not the 80 Reddit posts and 398 comments from Indian stock market communities that you've provided in your query.

To deliver the analysis you've requested with mandatory citations, I would need to:

1. **Analyze the Reddit data you've provided** (which I can do)
2. **Search for relevant news** to supplement that analysis (which requires actual search capability)

However, I can work with what you've given me. Here's what I can offer:

## ANALYSIS LIMITATION

The search results provided (EU-India FTA, pharma agreements, etc.) are **not relevant** to analyzing Indian stock market Reddit sentiment. To provide the comprehensive dual-analysis you've requested (Reddit sentiment + news context), I would need:

- **Real search results** about the stocks/topics mentioned in your Reddit dataset (Gold, Silver, Copper, Hindustan Copper, Rupee depreciation, etc.)
- Or confirmation that I should proceed with **Reddit analysis only** without the news supplementation

## WHAT I CAN DELIVER

If you'd like me to proceed with analyzing just the Reddit data you've provided, I can:
- Extract exact post/comment counts for each insight
- Identify the most discussed stocks with precise citations
- Flag speculative discussions and FOMO patterns
- Provide sentiment analysis by subreddit

**Would you like me to:**
1. Proceed with Reddit-only analysis using your provided dataset?
2. Provide a fresh search for relevant news about these stocks/topics?
3. Clarify which specific stocks/topics you'd like me to focus on for news research?

Please confirm your preferred approach, and I'll deliver the comprehensive analysis with mandatory citations as specified.
