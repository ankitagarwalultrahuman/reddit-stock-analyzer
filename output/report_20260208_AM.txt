## SECTOR TRENDS

- **Taxation/Policy (Govt Schemes, F&O, Dividends)**: 10+ posts, 300+ comments - Overwhelmingly bearish; anti-middle class, erodes trust.
- **IT/Tech**: 2 posts, 40 comments - Bearish on AI extinction risk for service firms.

## MARKET SENTIMENT SUMMARY

Overall **bearish** sentiment driven by policy changes (taxes/STT/SGB) eroding trader confidence (15+ posts, 500+ comments). Crypto and IT face volatility/AI headwinds. Trade deal neutralizes some negativity. Retail frustration high on govt "greed"; calls to avoid schemes. Limited bullishness on overseas ETFs/PSU banks.

## NEWS CONTEXT

- **[News Context] IT Sector**: Indian IT firms hit by global software selloff[1]; confirms Reddit bearish AI/threat views on TCS et al.
- **[News Context] India-US Trade Deal**: EU-India FTA concluded Jan 2026 (separate from US interim)[3]; Reddit US deal neutral/mixed aligns, but no direct stock impact noted.
- No specific recent news on SGB tax, HAL, or crypto dips in results; Reddit sentiment isolated to community policy gripes.

## CAUTION FLAGS

- Heavy anti-govt rhetoric in tax/STT posts risks emotional bias; no pump-and-dump but speculative court challenges (SGB).
- Crypto dip discussions speculative (BTC targets like $52k without data).
- Account handling scams flagged (StockMarketIndia_9: 1 post, 80 comments) - Telegram "experts" show initial profits then losses; users warn of traps, loans needed to settle.
- Multibaggers like Suzlon exit dilemmas (IndianStockMarket_9) show greed/hold bias; cyclical warnings ignored.
- DYOR essential; policy changes dominate but unverified (e.g., VDA tax debates). No overt pumps.
