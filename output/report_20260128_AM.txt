## SECTOR TRENDS

- **Commodities (Metals)**: 15 posts, 180+ comments – Strong bullish on silver/gold (Trump, geopolitics, physical squeeze); copper/aluminium hype but liquidity traps noted [IndianStockMarket_3,9,10].
- **Auto**: 4 posts, 40 comments – Bearish post-EU deal [IndianStreetBets_7; StockMarketIndia_12].
- **FMCG/Consumer**: 3 posts, 30 comments – Mixed; ITC drags, HUL eyed for budget [DalalStreetTalks_9].
- **Infra/Defense**: 2 posts, 10 comments – Bullish budget plays (L&T, BEL) [DalalStreetTalks_9].

## MARKET SENTIMENT SUMMARY

Overall **Bearish** tilt: Muted FTA reaction, FII absence, high valuations dominate (Nifty to 25k calls). Commodities provide bright spot but with caution (bubbles/corrections). Retail frustration high (portfolios down 20%, platform glitches); newbies chasing hype.

## NEWS CONTEXT

- **[News Context] India-EU FTA**: Confirmed as finalized after 20 years; tariffs slashed on 90% goods (EU cars 110%→10%, wines 150%→20-30%); doubles EU exports to India by 2032 but aids Indian textiles/pharma. Markets flat as phased rollout (months away). Confirms Reddit's "priced-in/no immediate impact" view [1].
- **[News Context] Silver/Gold**: Global physical squeeze intensifies (silver paper 6x inventory); Shanghai premium drains supply. Supports Reddit bullishness but validates correction/liquidity fears [1].
- **[News Context] ITC.NS**: No major recent news; aligns with Reddit's tax/ban focus.

## CAUTION FLAGS

- **Silver Hype**: Extreme bullishness (210% gains) risks bubble; repeated "crash tomorrow" posts (e.g., StockMarketIndia_13) show FOMO/panic mix – potential pump-and-dump vibes with profit-booking advice.
- **Budget Stock Picks**: Unsolicited lists (L&T/SBI/BEL) in low-score posts (DalalStreetTalks_9, IndiaStocks_2) feel promotional; speculative without deep DD.
- **General**: Heavy meme/discussion flairs (62+ comments on non-stock posts); avoid tip-based trades from friends/Telegram (IndianStreetBets_14). Always DYOR; past performance no guarantee.
